I am an MSCA Research Fellow at Simula Research Laboratory in the Data-Driven Software Engineering Department, supervised by Professor Leon Moonen.

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and software engineering, with a focus on non-functional optimization, fairness, and sustainability. In particular, I study how large language models trained on source code can be leveraged to detect and repair software vulnerabilities. As part of my Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions fellowship, I also investigate methods to reduce the data and energy requirements of training large language models for code-related tasks.
